# Array Exercises in Java

## Exercise 1: Create and Initialize an Array

1. Create a new integer array with a size of 5.
2. Initialize the values in the array with numbers of your choosing.

## Exercise 2: Create a Randomized Array

1. Use the `Random` class to generate random numbers.
2. Write a method that:
   - Takes an `int` parameter called `length`.
   - Returns a new array with a length of the given parameter and a random number at each index.

## Exercise 3: Find Largest and Smallest Numbers in an Array

1. Given the array `{10,15,3,66,4,9,1,100,2}`, write a method that:
   - Takes an input array as a parameter.
   - Returns the largest number in the array.
2. **BONUS**: Modify the method to also return the smallest number in the array.

## Exercise 4: Sum of Array Elements

1. Use the method from Exercise 2 to generate a new random integer array.
2. Write a new method called `sumArr` that:
   - Takes an integer array as input.
   - Returns the sum of all the values in the array.

## Exercise 5: Count Odd and Even Numbers

1. Write a method that:
   - Takes an integer array as input.
   - Returns a new array containing two elements:
     - The count of odd numbers.
     - The count of even numbers.
2. Example:
   - **Input**: `{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}`
   - **Output**: `{5,4}` (5 odd numbers, 4 even numbers)

## Exercise 6: Find Index of a Number in an Array

1. Write a method that:
   - Takes two arguments: an integer `number` and an integer array.
   - Returns the index at which the number appears in the array.
   - If the target number is not in the array, return `-1`.
2. Assume each number in the array is unique.

3. **BONUS**:
   - Modify the method to handle arrays with duplicate values and return the index of the first instance of the target number.

## BONUS Exercise: Rotate Array Elements

1. Write a method that:
   - Takes an integer array as input.
   - Rotates all the elements in the array to the right.
2. Example:
   - **Input**: `{1,2,3,4,5}`
   - **Output**: `{5,1,2,3,4}`

## BONUS 2 Exercise: Binary Search

1. Given a sorted array of unique values as an input parameter of an array and a target number that is contained in the array
2. Write a method that will return the index of a target number
3. Assume that the number is always in the array
4. **HINT** Arrays has a method called binarySearch
